Aliases Use Case
If you are planning to write multiple window functions that leverage the same PARTITION BY, OVER, and ORDER BY in a single query, leveraging aliases will help tighten your syntax.

Details of Aliases
A monthly_window alias function is defined at the end of the query in the WINDOW clause.
It is then called on each time an aggregate function is used within the SELECT clause.

SELECT order_id,
       order_total,
       order_price,
       SUM(order_total) OVER monthly_window AS running_monthly_sales,
       COUNT(order_id) OVER monthly_window AS running_monthly orders,
       AVG(order_price) OVER monthly_window AS average_monthly_price
FROM   amazon_sales_db
WHERE  order_date < '2017-01-01'
WINDOW monthly_window AS
       (PARTITION BY month(order_date) ORDER BY order_date);

SELECT id,
       account_id,
       DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at) AS year,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at)) AS dense_rank,
       total_amt_usd,
       SUM(total_amt_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at)) AS sum_total_amt_usd,
       COUNT(total_amt_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at)) AS count_total_amt_usd,
       AVG(total_amt_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at)) AS avg_total_amt_usd,
       MIN(total_amt_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at)) AS min_total_amt_usd,
       MAX(total_amt_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at)) AS max_total_amt_usd
