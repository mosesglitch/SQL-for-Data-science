-- LAG function
-- Purpose: It returns the value from a previous row to the current row in the table.


SELECT account_id, 
       standard_sum,
       LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag
FROM   (
        SELECT   account_id, SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
        FROM     orders
        GROUP BY 1
       ) sub

SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag,
       standard_sum - LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag_difference
FROM (
       SELECT account_id,
       SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
       FROM orders 
       GROUP BY 1
      ) sub

-- LEAD function
-- Purpose: Return the value from the row following the current row in the table.


SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lead
FROM   (
        SELECT   account_id,
                 SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
        FROM     orders
        GROUP BY 1
       ) sub

SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lead,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) - standard_sum AS lead_difference
FROM (
SELECT account_id,
       SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
       FROM orders 
       GROUP BY 1
     ) sub

LAG and LEAD
Use Case
When you need to compare the values in adjacent rows or rows that are offset by a certain number, LAG and LEAD come in very handy.

SELECT occurred_at,
       total_amt_usd,
       LEAD(total_amt_usd) OVER (ORDER BY occurred_at) AS lead,
       LEAD(total_amt_usd) OVER (ORDER BY occurred_at) - total_amt_usd AS lead_difference
FROM (
SELECT occurred_at,
       SUM(total_amt_usd) AS total_amt_usd
  FROM orders 
 GROUP BY 1
) sub
