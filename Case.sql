The CASE statement always goes in the SELECT clause.
-- CASE must include the following components: WHEN, THEN, and END. ELSE is an optional component to catch cases that didn’t meet any of the other previous CASE conditions.
-- You can make any conditional statement using any conditional operator (like WHERE) between WHEN and THEN. This includes stringing together multiple conditional statements using AND and OR.
-- You can include multiple WHEN statements, as well as an ELSE statement again, to deal with any unaddressed conditions.
