NTILE + the number of buckets youâ€™d like to create within a column (e.g., 100 buckets would create traditional percentiles, 4 buckets would create quartiles, etc.)
OVER
ORDER BY (optional, typically a date column)
AS + the new column name

NTILE(# of buckets) OVER (ORDER BY ranking_column) AS new_column_name
